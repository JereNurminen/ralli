# 3. Scoring (Style Points)

- Style points earned from:
  - Drift angle + duration (RWD focus)
  - Clean cornering at high speed
  - Near-miss traffic
  - Maintaining "flow" multiplier (continuous good driving)
- Penalties:
  - Barrier hits / ditch hits
  - Stalling / reversing / extreme slowdowns
  - Repeated off-road grinding

**MVP:** keep scoring readable: 2–3 primary events + multiplier.
