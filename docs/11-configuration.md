Recommended assets:
- `CarHandlingConfig` (steering, suspension, grip, tire slip curves, boost, power/brakes, stability aids)
- `SurfaceFrictionConfig` (μ values, wetness reduction, speed curve)
- `RoadProfile` (cross-section samples + band tags)
- `RoadGenerationConfig` (chunk length, sampling density, curvature/hills)
- `DifficultyConfig` (threat speed curve, traffic density curve, score multipliers)
