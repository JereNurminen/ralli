# 9. Service Stops (Post-MVP)

**Not in MVP.** When introduced:

- Stops appear at **distance/section intervals** (not biome transitions).
- While stopped, time buffer drains at baseline threat speed.

Initial stop actions:
- **Random upgrade parts (roguelike):** choose 1 of 2–3 offers; rarity + ±stat wiggle.
- **Repairs:** reduce damage/penalties.
- **Intel:** preview upcoming section traits (curves/surfaces/hazards).

Costs:
- **Time buffer** + **style points**.

No tuning in the first stop implementation.
