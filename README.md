# Ralli 

Trying out using Claude to code a Unity game. All code has been generated, the only assets included (tree models and textures) are from [Quaternius](https://quaternius.com/packs/stylizedtree.html), licensed under CC0.

## Includes

* Loosely physics based driving mechanics
* Randomly generated road with some pre-defined parts
* Simple yet surprisingly buggy NPC traffic
* Very simple and ugly, mostly shader-based traffic
* Some effects (tire smoke, tire tracks)
